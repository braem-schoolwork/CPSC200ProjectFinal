===================

Sorting Algorithms

Program can run sorts on selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort (with either shell, knuth, or tokuda gap sequences),
merge sort, a hybrid of merge sort using insertion sort, quicksort, and a hybrid of quicksort using insertion sort.
The results from these experiments (time required, memory usage, etc.) are outputted.

There is functionally to run a variety of different experiments. This writes the results to a .csv file in C:\\.
This is ment to be open with excel and generate graphs of these experiment.

There is also a unit test section which contains unit tests for all methods that make sense. Hardcoded tests with
outputs of success, and if failure, which method fails.

This is a ongoing project for my CPSC200 class. Algorithm Analysis.
